    Added support for setting volume image property.

    Image properties are copied from image when volume is created.
    But since a volume is mutable, user sometime wants to update
    image properties for volume.

    So, this fix enables user to update image properties of volume
    using below command:
    ``volume set --image-property <key=value> <volume>``.
